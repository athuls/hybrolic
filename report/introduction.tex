Hybrid automata provide a generic framework for modeling embedded systems with continuous and dense variables, such as controllers for plants, reactors or for robot motion planning.
It is often meaningful to ask questions such as whether a given hybrid system reaches some \emph{error} state. For safety critical systems such as nuclear power plants, it becomes quite important to verify that the system does not crash. There is a rich literature on verification of hybrid systems to tackle this problem. However, it turns out that the general model of Hybrid automata is quite expressive and not surprisingly, very simple questions like reachability are undecidable, and heuristics based techniques for answering such verification questions are not known to scale well.
As part of this project, we intend to develop systematic techniques for answering questions such as reachability of some state in hybrid systems, using concepts from automated test input generation.
